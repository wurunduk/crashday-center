### **Introduction**

Paint.net is a free program and relatively simple in terms of interface and UI compared to it's other 'rivals', like Gimp or Photoshop, while still featuring many tools and features, like layers and effects. Such effects and adjustments can still be expanded thanks to Paint.net's community based focus and customizable nature, with the help of plugins, some of which are very useful for modding this game. So overall, thanks to it's simplicity, it's recommended for beginners, and thanks to it's customizability it's very useful to more advanced modders aswell.

With that out of the way, it should be noted that these tips will be more focused for more novice users, who want to improve their work's quality and/or create mods in similiar quality to the vanilla assets (or even better).

### **Layer types**

These can be chosen by clicking *Wrench* icon *(a.k.a. Properties)* on the *Layers* window, while having your desired layer selected. Here is list of some of the most useful ones, and explaining why.

**Multiply:** This, when added to an above layer, takes the colors of the layer below it, and multiplies/mixes them together, making the above layer a sort of mask.

This is very useful sort of 'baking' liverys onto an Ambient Occlusion baked body texture and if you want to replicate how vanilla game liverys look like (as they were probably made this exact way).
