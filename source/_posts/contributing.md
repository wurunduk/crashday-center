## How to contribute to crashdaycenter.com
Everyone can help in filling crashdaycenter with useful modding info. If you have something to contribute, contact *@wurunduk#0001* in official CD discord and ask for access.
When you have access, goto [Admin Panel](https://crashdaycenter.com/admin/) and add your articles. But be sure to follow the guidelines!

## Article guidelines

This site uses markdown for content, here is cheat sheet if you need one: [Github markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
The admin panel also provides a visual editor, so you dont need to edit any markdown if you want.

Here are some rules to use when making articles:
* "ADD PAGE NAVIGATION" should be enabled only for long articles containing a lot of info. This option adds a \'Catalogue\' panel on the right based on headers
* \` \` Red highlight should be used for all paths, file names, extensions and to highlight any relevant info
* \> Quote can be used to quote or to highlight an unchecked or unkown information
* Be sure to correctly categorise a new article. To add an article to _Documentation -> Other_ you would use _"Documentation, Other"_
* If you want to add a new category, you can do so. But please tell *@wurunduk#0001* so he can fix the ordering in the menus

In general, try to make the content easy readable, split it up into chunks, add images.

Thanks for contributing!
